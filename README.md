# codeRefactorAccessibility

Our task for the homework this week was to take existing code and refactor it to meet accessibility standards. In particular, the HTML we were given consisted mainly of div tags, so I first refactored the code to use more semantic HTML syntax, as well as made sure all img tag contained a alt attribute for accessibility. 

We were also tasked with honoring the Scout's Rule of working with existing code, but always leaving it cleaner than when you started. For this project I cleaned up the code by making sure all the links on the webpage worked and by cleaning up the CSS to make a more conscise codebase. 

By the end of the project, we were left with a webpage that looked exactly the same as before, but the code was much cleaner, functioning and accessible. The final product can be seen below.
